// idea - I want to create a basic form fillout website (contact info to sign for mailing list)

// Then I want to programatically send an email on each form submission.
// use a click on button button to do the thing: 
//A click on a button button does... nothing! That sounds silly, but it's amazingly useful 
// for building custom buttons â€” you can define their chosen functionality with JavaScript.

// Also then take the information from the form and have the person be an object / marketing item.
